Over the course of human history, many regime changes, in the form of revolutions, coups, or a much more peaceful transition of governing power and ideology, have taken place in different parts of the world. Since such drastic changes invariably leave a mark on society, it would be interesting to analyze a few of those factors affecting the country and draw a comparison of the influence on these between countries.

We have planned to explore and correlate some of the following characteristics:

* Mortality Rate
    * Deaths by gender
    * Deaths by age groups 
    * Life-Expectancy at various stages of life
    * Infant Mortality Rate
* Adult Age Mortality
    * Population
    * Total Population
    * Total Population by gender
    * Population Growth Rate
* Migration
    * Net Migration Rate
    * Net Number of Immigrants
    * Fertility
* Number of births
    * Sex ratio at birth 
    * Age specific fertility rate
    * Mean age of childbearing

## Hypotheses:

* Hypothesis 1: We expect the adult mortality rate to decrease post the killing of Col Gaddafi in Libya in 2011.

* Hypothesis 2: In most of the cases with an increase in life-expectancy rate, the net migration rate decreases i.e. life-expectancy rate and net migration rate are negatively correlated.

* Hypothesis 3: Post the election of Angela Merkel as the first woman Chancellor of Germany in 2005,  the female mortality rate before age 60 has decreased along with it being lower than the male mortality rate before age 60 post Angela Merkel's election.

* Hypothesis 4 : We expect the mean age of childbearing to be higher in well-developed societies. Hence, the mean age of childbearing must have increased post the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany in 1989. While in all the subsequent events which swayed away from democratic systems, and those that occurred in under-developed or developing countries, the mean age of childbearing decreased.
