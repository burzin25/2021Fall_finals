## Description

August 2021, U.S. officially withdraws from Afghanistan after 20 years. Ever since U.S. announced its withdrawl policy from Afghanistan, and post its hasty withdrawl, there seems to be a common belief amongst the masses that, following the takeover by Taliban, there will be widespread anarchy and destruction of social compass of society. Only time will tell us how gruesome this takeover by taliban turns out to be. 
    
Through this project, we aim to verify the affects of such drastic regime changes which have occured in last 70 years in some of the countries of the world. 
    
We are referring to the data archive provided by the United Nations: Department of Economic and Social Affairs. 

We have planned to explore and correlate some of the following characteristics:

* Mortality Rate
    * Deaths by gender
    * Deaths by age groups 
    * Life-Expectancy at various stages of life
    * Infant Mortality Rate
* Adult Age Mortality
    * Population
    * Total Population
    * Total Population by gender
    * Population Growth Rate
* Migration
    * Net Migration Rate
    * Net Number of Immigrants
    * Fertility
* Number of births
    * Sex ratio at birth 
    * Age specific fertility rate
    * Mean age of childbearing

## Hypotheses:

* Hypothesis 1: We expect the adult mortality rate to decrease post the killing of Col Gaddafi in Libya in 2011.

* Hypothesis 2: In most of the cases with an increase in life-expectancy rate, the net migration rate decreases i.e. life-expectancy rate and net migration rate are negatively correlated.

* Hypothesis 3: Post the election of Angela Merkel as the first woman Chancellor of Germany in 2005,  the female mortality rate before age 60 has decreased along with it being lower than the male mortality rate before age 60 post Angela Merkel's election.

* Hypothesis 4 : We expect the mean age of childbearing to be higher in well-developed societies. Hence, the mean age of childbearing must have increased post the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany in 1989. While in all the subsequent events which swayed away from democratic systems, and those that occurred in under-developed or developing countries, the mean age of childbearing decreased.
